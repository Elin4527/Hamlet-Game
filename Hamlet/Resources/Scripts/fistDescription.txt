Items give you skills to use. By using the [Tab] key Hamlet can switch his use item to get access to different skills. Skills are portrayed in the top right corner of the screen. Up to 4 Skills can be used through the keys Q, W, E, and R. After using a skill it will go cooldown before it can be used again. @w
The Fist item allows Hamlet to use the punch skill and fight against enemies. The fist gives you only one skill that can be used with Q. Punch is a skill that damages enemies in a circle in front of you and slightly pushes them back. @w Proceed to the green square in the middle to proceed to the first level. @em10~10~Data/Level/room2.txt
