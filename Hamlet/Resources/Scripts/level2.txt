The King's ghost has appeared. Hamlet'll call thee "Hamlet," "King," "Father, "royal Dane". Let him not burst in ignorance, and catch the ghost and hear what he has to say. The ghost seems to fade in and out of existence. Catch him and see why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death, have burst their cerements.
