[Level 4: I loved you ever.] @n
The noble, Laertes is enraged over the death of his father, Polonius. His sister, the fair Ophelia, has also drowned herself in madness. You loved Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers could not with all their quantity of love make up your sum. What wilt thou do for her? @p30 Well, obviously duel Laertes who is out for revenge. Everyone thinks Laertes is the best since he went to France, however you do not think so. Defeat Laertes 3 times to show him who is truly the best.
