Ever since meeting your father's ghost you've been putting on an act of madness. Polonius has been looking for the cause of your madness believing it to be his daughter, the fair Ophelia. Yet he is not good enough to see through your words, words, words. He cannot take from Hamlet anything that you will willingly part withal. Polonius once acted in a play and played Julius Caesar. Wouldn't it be brutish of you, to kill so capital a guy.
