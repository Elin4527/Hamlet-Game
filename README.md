# Hamlet-Game
Game based on Hamlet made for a Grade 12 English creative assignment using SFML.

This was made in about 100 hours for an English assignment. Some of the code is very messy and uncommented. 
Since I had a deadline to complete the assignment some of the techniques are very rough such as when I put
event handling into the TileMap and TextBox for events instead of creating a proper event handling class.
I used SFML for my graphics library and used some resources online to help design the engine.

Originally this was a seperate project I was working on, but I decided to use it for my English project,
which is why some files are called BloodNight as opposed to Hamlet.

This project was made using Visual Studio Community 2015. When building make sure to put a copy of all the
folders in resources (Data, Font, Images, Scripts) in to the output folder, either Hamlet/Game/Debug or
Hamlet/Game/Release depending on target build.
